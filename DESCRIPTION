Title: bot
Depends:
    fork
Description: BoT (stands for Bag of Tasks) is an R package allowing to
    distribute independent tasks over many cores and many computing nodes. The
    simple fact that BoT is based on the process forking feature and task locking
    over file system makes BoT compatible with most of computing infrastructures
    (multicore, clusters, grids, clouds). Using BoT, each task is a set of
    parameters associated with a user-defined function built on an R process. Next
    step consists in forking this R process for each core of the computing node.
    Finally, the forked set of tasks is randomized and executed in a parallel way.
    When a task starts a distributed lock is taken. This avoids redundant task
    execution. When a task is ended, result is dumped into a file. BoT is used to
    compute NGS data in the SiGHT project context (ERC-StG2011-281359). BoT has
    been tested on two infrastructures: Grid'5000 experimental testbed (https://
    www.grid5000.fr) and PSMN computing center of ENS de Lyon (http://www.ens-
    lyon.fr/PSMN). For more information on how to use bot, have a look on the
    examples of the help ?bot::run_engine and ?bot::botapply.
